# Background
I'm a math student at the [University of Northern Iowa](https://uni.edu/math/welcome-uni-department-mathematics). Throughout my time as a student, I've had the opportunity to take multiple inquiry-based courses including [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology), [Advanced Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis) 1 & 2, and [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra). These courses provide a level of independent learning unparalleled in other courses while also encouraging teamwork. For this reason, these courses made a huge impact on me as a student, and I'm confident that I've learned more in these courses compared to my other classes in the math curriculum. Thus, I've set out to develop an inquiry-based course guide for a set theory class with [Dr. Stanley](adrienne.stanley@uni.edu) from the UNI math department. For courses like Advanced Calc 1 & 2, we were able to follow a course outline developed by another professor (with some minor alterations). This worked quite well, but the problem is that there are no similar course packets/guides for a university level set theory course. My goal is to develop a quality set theory packet which can help shepherd students through the course as they take set theory in an inquiry-based environment.


# Goal
The goal is to develop an inquiry-based learning outline for a modern Set Theory course at the university level. Ideally, students will have completed DAM (discrete and argumentive mathematics). Similar course outlines for other inquiry-based learning courses exist, but none for set theory (Until now). [Inquiry based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning) is a form of teaching that begins with asking questions. From there, students are encouraged to work together, report their results, and critique each other in order to develop a better understanding of the course material. Inquiry-based courses encourage research, independence, and teamwork when needed. It's not uncommon for students to develop their own questions throughout a course, bring them to their fellow classmates, and work together to find an answer. This exploratory mindset is something I wish to encourage in my course packet. Like I said before, it starts with raising questions. Thus, in the end, this packet will consist primarily of questions which the students will work on. The questions will be carefully chosen and will work together to help students fully understand the core principles of set theory. When complete, I should have a course packet/outline with various questions/definitions/theorem's which will aid students in learning the important concepts in Set Theory throughout an entire semester.

I will accomplish this task throughout the 2019 school year by using a number of different tactics including: 
- Reading the **recommended** textbook
- Asking other set theory professors at other universities what they teach/important concepts
- Speaking with other inquiry-based learning instructors to find the greatest tactics for learning in such a unique environment
- Analyzing the current courses dynamic to see which questions/ideas seem particularly important which should be kept when creating the new packet.

I intend to document every process I take as well as my results/progress each week. These results will be posted here on GitHub so that in the future, any interested professors can examine why we included any specific question/theorem. Hopefully, every single theorem/problem will be documented in a way that explains why it was included and what impact it has on the learning objectives of the course. In a perfect world, the packet consists of questions and problems ranging from easy to advanced. No learning has ever taken place without a thoughtful challenge! Not only will the course help students become proficient set theorists, but it will help them become better problem solvers.

*"The value of an education in a liberal arts college is not the learning of many facts, but the training of the mind to think something that cannot be learned from textbooks" - Albert Einstein*

I'm hoping that this packet can be of use at other universities teaching set theory. Below is the plan I intend to take throughout the semester in order to achieve my goals. This plan is subject to change as I work with Dr. Stanley, but note, that any changes will be heavily documented in a way that will make it clear to the reader what our plan is.


# Outline/Plan
- Contact Jake Weber (a fellow classmate) each week to get the weekly notes from the Fall 2018 class. These will be stored on the Github page and parsed/summarized to find relevant information
- Work with Dr. Stanley to find out what questions were asked each week. Analyze the questions and decide if any are of great use to our objective(s)
- Reach out to other professors at other universities who teach set theory. Find out what they hope to accomplish when teaching a class
- Reach out to other professors who teach inquiry-based learning type courses. (Not necessarily set theory or even math). Find out what tactics they use to benefit the students, and ask  about just why inquiry-based learning is suitable for their course
- Read the course textbook in order to see where the class is at relevant to the overarching topics
- Develop questions related to key theorems to challenge students learning as they progress through the course
- Document everything on GitHub in a readable and understandable format
- Post all notes to GitHub in a folder within the repository
- Utilize LateX when necessary to write up questions/theorems in formal mathematical logic

Stay tuned as I delve into the wonderful world of set theory and hopefully develop something beneficial along the way
