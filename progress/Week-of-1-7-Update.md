# Week Of 1/7 New Years Research Update
Long time, no see. It's been some time since I updated this repository (since before Thanksgiving), but the time has come to dive back into research. This update will be a little less informational, and more about documenting the overall goal for the spring semester (so that I don't forget).

# Spring Semester
After meeting with Dr. Stanley over Christmas break, we've successfully laid out our plan for the coming months. First, [Eric Nichols](enichols@uni.edu) will be joining our team to finish the year and complete our research. Over the coming months, we are planning to finish our research document which will contain roughly ~ 1.5 semesters worth of information for an inquiry-based set theory class. This works out well because Dr. Stanley will be teaching set theory 2 in the Spring.

I've managed to update the [notes](../notes/) folder with all of Jakes notes through the first semester. Now we can dive into the heart of the content and begin fleshing out our document. Dr. Stanley and I decided that we will aim for a date of mid-March to be done with the packet's content. From there, the three of us will refine the document before submitting for publication in early May. 

For the coming weeks, Eric and I will be working through the core content of the class, starting from the middle of the course and working our way out. This means I will abandon the current chronologic structure of the packet (I got through week 6 earlier). We will be starting with the fundamentals of the course and going from there. We've also added a second source [(book)](https://www.amazon.com/Set-Theory-Studies-Logic-Mathematical/dp/1848900503) to use as a reference alongside our Roitman "Modern Set Theory" text.

Over the coming weeks, I'll be working with Eric and Dr. Stanley to add content to our document. I'm not sure if I'll be moving the documentation to a different location (that way Eric can contribute), but nonetheless, I will mirror whatever new documentation format comes up (if one does) here. All notes will be posted here. Next week, I should have an actual content update posted.


## For next week
- Figure out where Dr. Stanley wants to start in terms of the "middle content" as we discussed and go to work. I've sent an e-mail and am currently waiting for a response.
- Send Eric any of the materials accumulated thus far (if he needs it).
