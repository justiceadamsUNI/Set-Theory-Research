# Week Of 10/29 Research Update

## Reading/Addition to the documentation ##
This week I spent my time continuing to read about the set axioms, construction of the natural numbers with copies of the empty set, and ordinals. I managed to work through more of the problems relevant to set axioms (Weeks 4-5)  and added them to the LateX document which will eventually become our final document. At this point, there is roughly the first 4.5-5 weeks of the course added to the document. You can read it here: [link](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Set-Theory-Research/blob/master/pdf/Set_Theory_Doc_10-29.pdf)

Most of this weeks content came from working through class problems while I referred to jakes class Notes. Thank god he does such a good job taking notes in class. It's also worth noting that I pushed a new set of notes [here](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Set-Theory-Research/tree/master/notes). Pretty soon the class will be over and I'll have all the information I need to sit down and finish the content of the packet* (there's more work to do after that though).

I also have a bit of feedback from Dr. Stanley I'm hoping to incorporate soon. Basically, some notes and recommendations from the current state of the packet before this update. Maybe I'll circle back to that next week, but I haven't quite decided how I want to tackle revisions. Me and Dr. Stanley are planning on possibly meeting over Thanksgiving, so maybe I'll wait to bombard her with questions then... regardless, I'll document any decisions here. Those notes are private and will not be uploaded to this repo.

## Questions regarding content: ##
- I decided to define ordinal formally. Did I define ordinal in the right spot relative to the packet?
- Problem 16. The natural numbers. The only way I understood this is from reading the book where they basically define the naturals as repeated copies of the empty set (extensions). Is this covered in class? I didn't see it anywhere and if not, the question seems unfair...
- Well ordered. Do I need to define it? see definition 16 in the packet
- Should all lemmas/theorem's be problems? See problem 19. Can we just state it or should I make it a problem? So far, I've made everything a problem
- Problem 21: Should this be broken up? They are all very relevant questions stemming from the fact that X is transitive, so I think they belong together

Most of the questions above are directly for Dr. Stanley.

## For next week
- Continue to add week 5 and 6 content and read any relevant sections from the textbook.
- Determine if we should move any of this new content around. If so, document any planned changes.
- Potentially circle back and review the structure of the content so far (although I might hold off on this until the very end of content addition).
- Do a little cleaning if there's time. Spell check, spacing, things like that. This would make life easier later...

See you next week!
