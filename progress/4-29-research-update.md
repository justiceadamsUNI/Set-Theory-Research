# Week Of 4/29 Research Update
I haven't updated this repository in while. Most of our research documentation has taken place over e-mail. With that being said, over the last few months, we've made significant progress with our Set Theory document. We have 8 chapters fleshed out and are currently fine-tuning our content before our final edit pass next week.

# The current state of the document

# Things to do/ Notes from our discussion(s)
Our ~30-page document is coming to its end (hopefully). The next step is editing and submitting for publication. Here are the current pieces of the document I'm planning on re-examining soon

**Problems I found with content location (in order)**
- Chapter 2 problem 16 references ordinals before they are defined. It should probably be moved
- Chapter 3 problem 31 & 32. We need lim & succ defined

**Problems I found with wording content (in order)**
- Chapter 2 axiom 8 is worded poorly ("Then for any set w the domain of,..."). I wrote this, it's gross. Halp me.
- Chapter 4 definition 17 we don't actually define bijection and injection it seems. This is also in a weird spot because, is this not technically talking about cardinality? (it seems so).
- Chapter 5 Theorem 8: Should we define transfinite induction? Or is that the professor's job?
- Chapter 5 definition 24. The definition of continuous has "class" in it. I think we should define this. This confused me greatly my first time through.
- Chapter 7 problem 56: Omega_1 comes out of nowhere. I only know what this is from topology. We should probably define it, yes?
- Chapter 7 Definition 35: Is the Beta a typo? should that be kappa?

**Problems I didn't solve (in order):**
- Chapter 2 problem 13
- Chapter 3 problem 21
- Chapter 4 lemma 5 proof (I gave up)
- Chapter 4 problem 34
- Chapter 5 Question 7
- Chapter 5 Question 53 (I did this problem. It's just an honorable mention because it stumped me for a while)
- Chapter 5 theorem 11
- Chapter 7 Problem 61
- Chapter 7 question 8
- Chapter 7 question 68 (waiting on our discussion to solve this)

**Weird things to consider (in order):**
- Chapter 3 problem 19. When I solved this, I used the knowledge I gained from the textbook where they build the natural numbers with copies/extensions of the empty set. Should we "define" that somewhere?
- We need to decide where to define Lim and Succ before Chapter 3 problem 31 & 32
- Chapter 4 lemma 8. What is the Q_n? What is that notation?
- Chapter 5 lemma 11 the spacing bothers me. I tried to fix it. Might try again. If it bothers anyone else I'll give it a go.

**Issues with chapter 7:**
In chapter 7, there are some places where we state things like "for every cardinal", when really I think we mean "For every infinite cardinal". I'm not sure if my understanding is wrong, or our content is written wrong. I'll save this discussion for tomorrow to find out. So there's a chance this entire paragraph is useless. Anyway, here's the problems I noted it in:
- Lemma 25 & lemma 26
- Lemma 28, 29, 30
- Definition 38/39 : (what about not-infinite ordinals)
