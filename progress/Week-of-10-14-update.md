# Week Of 10/14 Research Update

## Addition to the documentation ##
This week I spent my time briefly wrapping up my reading of Chapter 3, then I dove straight into Dr. Stanley's and Jake's class notes to follow along with the corresponding coursework. I managed to work through the problems relevant to set axioms (except for one problem... more on that later) and added them to the LateX document which will eventually become our final document. At this point, there isroughly the first 3.5 weeks of the course added to the document. You can read it here: [link](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Set-Theory-Research/blob/master/pdf/Set_Theory_Doc_10-23.pdf)

Most of this weeks content came from working through both problems I had while reading the book as well as the problems Dr. Stanley asked this semester's class. Here are some lingering questions I need to get answered regarding the new content I've added

## Questions regarding content: ##
- Should I highlight the instructor's notes? Make them bold or red perhaps? This could potentially be sorted out once we finish with content and move on to the editing phase, but it's worth documenting this thought in my opinion.
- I added problem 8 to give students experience with understanding ordered pairs as defined here. For most of my mathematical career, I've never thought about ordered pairs as sets, so for me, this was helpful to better understand the definition. It may need adjusting.
- I decided to use the mantra "Prove or Disprove" for each question rather than just "Prove" or "Disprove". Partly because I am evil, but also because I think it encourages exploration. In an inquiry-based class, there's nothing wrong with taking the wrong approach as I've done many times in the past.
- One question seems to be left out for now: If there exists a set then there exists an empty set. The proof of this is straightforward, but it doesn't seem straightforward at all. Nor does it really stem from the axioms defined earlier in the document. I think this might need to be an instructor exercise, but we'll see.
- Should we add the axiom of infinity here, or wait for later? Dr. Stanley's notes imply that waiting for later might be better.
- Should we define "ordinal"?

Most of the questions above are directly for Dr. Stanley.

I've run out of notes on Jake's end, so I'll be reaching out to him for more of his class notes, which I will add to this repository promptly. 

## For next week
- Pester Dr. Stanley until she responds with the above questions regarding content, as well as last weeks questions regarding the initial document's questions. Once complete, I'll circle back and adjust the content accordingly.
- Continue to add the next 4 axioms to the document and continue to work through/add problems to the document.
- Reach out to Jake for more of his notes
- Decide where to add the axiom of infinity (and other subsequent axioms).
- Potentially circle back and review the structure of the content so far (although I might hold off on this until the very end of content addition).

Next week I should hopefully* have a document with all the axioms in place.
