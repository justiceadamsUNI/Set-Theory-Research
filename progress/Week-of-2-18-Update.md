# Week Of 2/18 Research Update
It seems I haven't written up a formal update in quite some time. This is partly because my team does a weekly meeting where we talk over what needs to be done for the coming week. Due to this agile like standup-hybrid, I haven't felt the need to post a formal write up on this repo, but I'm going to try to periodically keep this up to date, as it serves as a way to show our progress.

# A restructure to the content
Over the last few weeks, we've discussed how we should structure our final deliverable. We wanted to accurately represent the different sections/areas of Set Theory that we feel should be present in our final publication. We came up with the following chapters which will divide our material
- Foundations
- Axioms and Transitivity
- Ordinals
- Mathematical Universe
- Ordinal Arithmetic
- The Axiom of Choice
- Cardinal Arithmetic
- Clubs and Stationery Sets
- Tree

You'll notice that this content covers more then what's covered in one semester of content. We decided to expand our boundaries a bit so that our "packet" as I will refer to it, will include more than one semester's worth of content (probably around 1.5 semesters worth)

# Spacing/Proofreading
Right now, we have roughly half of the content in place. We have started the process of cleaning the packet (to an extent), but mainly this is being handled by Dr. Stanley (for now). As me and eric focus on content, she is actively reviewing our work. You might notice that the spacing/layout of the document has been modified slightly as well. In my opinion, it provides for a cleaner look to the document

# Content
As of right now, we have completed (for the most part) the Foundations, Axioms and Transitivity,  Ordinals, and Ordinal Arithmetic sections of the document. We are actively working on the Mathematical Universe and The Axiom of Choice sections of the document. I suspect the Mathematical Universe portion of the document will be fairly light based on how the class went the first semester. We are still aiming for a mid-march content completion date, and you can read the current version of the PDF [here](../pdf/Set_Theory_Doc_2-18.pdf)

# For next weeks
- Complete Mathematical Universe section
- Adjust the previous content at all if needed

# Sources
- Modern Set Theory - Judith Roitman
- Set Theory - Kenneth Kunen
